This file describes the file format of a RSETTLER game map.

A map is a plaintext file containing the definition of
a map for the game. The format is as follows:

Line:  Content:
  1    The name of the map
  2    The author of the map
  3    The width (in tiles) of the map
  4    The height (in tiles) of the map
  5..  All the following lines contain the map data.
       Each tile is represented by a character. The
       data has a length of width*height characters.

A character describing a tile can be one of:

  X - Sea Tile
  C - Clay Tile
  W - Wood Tile
  S - Sheep Tile
  E - Weed Tile
  G - Gold Tile
  D - Desert Tile

  <any other character> - empty, no tile

  The characters can be lowercase or uppercase.
  A lowercase character specifies a tile with an
  fixed position. An uppercase letter defines a
  tile that will be randomized when the board is
  created.

As an example the default map (StandardSettlers.rms)
is appended. Each line begins with a number that is
the number of the the line in the file.
